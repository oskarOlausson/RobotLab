•	AngleIncrement, the difference between the angles where the laser reads
•	EndAngle, the leftmost angle
•	StartAngle, the rightmost angle
•	Pose (is a struct of position and orientation)
o	Orientation (w,x,y,z)  is written as a quartion (or something) how the robot is turned
o	Position (x,y,z), its place in the 3d-world (one of them should be about the same all the time, maybe it’s the z-axis)

In all of the dictionaries where we only read information (which is all but the differentialDrive) the process of getting the information is almost the same.


Differentialdrive
{Command{TargetAngularSpeed0.4,TargetLinearSpeed0.1},Feedback{CurrentAngularSpeed0.40000003576278687,CurrentLinearSpeed0.10000000894069672,Enabledtrue},Properties{MaxAngularAcceleration6,MaxAngularDeceleration6,MaxAngularSpeed2,MaxLinearAcceleration2,MaxLinearDeceleration2,MaxLinearSpeed1,MinAngularSpeed-2,MinLinearSpeed-1,Width0.40000000596046448},Timestamp1876533}

The interface for which we control the robots movement and reads the robots movements.
The command-part is so we can tell it what to do and the Feedback-part is so we can read what the robot is doing right now.
To alter the speed of the robot in python we make a json dump.
This first part is connecting to  MRFS_URL='localhost50000'

mrds = httplib.HTTPConnection(MRDS_URL)

variableName=json.dumps({'TargetAngularSpeed' angularSpeed, 'TargetLinearSpeed' linearSpeed})

•	TargetAngularSpeed is how fast the robot shall spin. (-2 to 2)
•	TargetLinearSpeed is how fast it should drive (-1 to 1)

And then we request 
mrds.request('POST', 'lokarriadifferentialdrive', variableName, HEADERS)
•	POST means we are telling it to do something rather than asking,
•	lokarriadifferentialdrive is where we are sending the information
•	Then we toss in the json-dump.
•	Header är lite saker som ska vara med men de är alltid samma

HEADERS = {Content-type applicationjson, Accept textjson}
